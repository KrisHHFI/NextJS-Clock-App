### About

- A browser based clock app
- Made in the summer of 2024
- First I made a Next.js project, then I integrated my "Clock" project code (a previous project from 2023). The clock previously had a fixed size but I made it adjust according to the screen size. I also added some social icons.
- The clock itself can be clicked, which reveals the gears beneath. The clock was made with AI generated images, custom CSS shapes and powered with JavaScript.
